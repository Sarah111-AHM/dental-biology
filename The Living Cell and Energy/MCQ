A) Additional product would be formed.
B) Additional substrate would be formed.
C) The reaction would change from endergonic to exergonic.
D) The free energy of the system would change.

6. Some bacteria are metabolically active in hot springs because

A) they are able to maintain a cooler internal temperature.
B) high temperatures make catalysis unnecessary.
C) their enzymes have high optimal temperatures.
D) their enzymes are completely insensitive to temperature.

7. Which reaction would prevail if both Q and S were present in the cell in high concentrations?

(Based on the described branched pathway)
A) L → M
B) M → O
C) L → N
D) O → P
E) R → S
✅ Answer: C

---

Pathway Summary:

· L → M or L → N
· M → O
· O → P or O → R
· P → Q
· R → S
· O inhibits L → M
· Q inhibits O → P
· S inhibits O → R

If both Q and S are high:

· Q inhibits O → P
· S inhibits O → R
· O accumulates, inhibiting L → M
· Therefore, L → N prevails.

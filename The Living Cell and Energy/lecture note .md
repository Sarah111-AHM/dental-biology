1. The Cell as an Energy Factory

Concept: The living cell functions as a miniature chemical factory, conducting thousands of chemical reactions.

Function:

Extracts energy from molecules.

Uses energy to perform work.


Example: Some organisms convert energy into light via bioluminescence (e.g., fireflies, deep-sea jellyfish).

2. Metabolism: Transforming Matter and Energy

Definition: Metabolism is the sum of all chemical reactions in an organism.

Nature:

An emergent property of life.

Arises from molecular interactions within cells.


Guiding Principle: Subject to the laws of thermodynamics.



---

3. Metabolic Pathways

Definition: A metabolic pathway is a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that transform a specific starting molecule into a final product.

Structure Example:


Step	Enzyme	Substrate → Product

1	Enzyme 1	A → B
2	Enzyme 2	B → C
3	Enzyme 3	C → D


Key Concept: Each step requires a specific enzyme.

4. Catabolic Pathways

Definition: Catabolic pathways break down complex molecules into simpler compounds, releasing energy.

Example: Cellular respiration:

Breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen.

Produces energy for the cell to use.




---
1. Anabolic Pathways

Definition: Anabolic pathways are metabolic processes that consume energy to construct complex molecules from simpler ones.

Example: Protein synthesis:

Building proteins from amino acids.


Key Concept: Opposite of catabolism; requires energy input.

2. Bioenergetics

Definition: Bioenergetics is the study of how organisms obtain, transform, and use energy to perform work.

Importance: Helps explain metabolism, growth, movement, and cellular processes.

3. Forms of Energy

Energy: The capacity to cause change.

Key Forms:

1. Kinetic energy: Energy associated with motion.

Example: Moving muscles, flowing water.



2. Heat (thermal energy): A type of kinetic energy from random atomic/molecular motion.

Example: Body temperature.



3. Potential energy: Energy stored due to position or structure.

Example: A rock at the top of a hill.



4. Chemical energy: Potential energy stored in chemical bonds, released in reactions.

Example: Glucose breakdown in cellular respiration.

4. Energy Conversion

Principle: Energy can transform from one form to another, e.g.:

Muscle movement (kinetic) → climbing a platform (potential).

Diving from a platform: Potential energy → kinetic energy in water.


Example Diagram: A diver’s energy changes between platform and water.

1. Thermodynamics and Energy Transformation

Definition: Thermodynamics is the study of energy transformations.

Types of Systems:

Closed system: Isolated from surroundings; no energy or matter exchange.

Example: Liquid in a thermos.


Open system: Exchanges energy and matter with surroundings.

Example: Living organisms.



Key Concept: Organisms are open systems, constantly exchanging energy and matter.



---

2. The First Law of Thermodynamics

Definition: The energy of the universe is constant.

Principle: Energy can be transferred and transformed, but cannot be created or destroyed.

Alternate Name: Law of Energy Conservation.

Example:

Chemical energy in food → Kinetic energy for muscle movement → Heat energy released.
